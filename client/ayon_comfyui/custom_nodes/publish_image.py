        The node will always be re executed if any of the inputs change but
        this method can be used to force the node to execute again even when the inputs don't change.
        You can make this node return a number or a string. This value will be compared to the one returned the last time the node was
        executed, if it is different the node will be executed again.
        This method is used in the core repo for the LoadImage node where they return the image hash as a string, if the image hash
        changes between executions the LoadImage node is executed again.
